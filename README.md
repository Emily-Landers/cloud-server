# cloud-server
# AWS Deployment

This is a super vanilla app deployed on AWS EC2.

## Process

To create this app, I created a remote repo using the following commands:

`git init`

`git add -A`

`git commit -m "Initial Commit"`

### Feature Tasks

- Deploy a simple Node.js server to EC2, using Elastic Beanstalk

- Choose a server youâ€™ve built previously Option 1: A simple API or Web Server Option.

**Feature Task 1:**
Create a new environment, using Elastic Beanstalk from the AWS Control Panel (GUI) Manually deploy your application to this environment by uploading a .zip file

**Feature Task 2:**

Using the same server, create a new environment using Elastic Beanstalk from your terminal Manually deploy your application to this environment by using eb deploy Documentation In your README.md include: The links to both of your deployed servers (GUI deploy and CLI deploy) Document your processes
